# discord-yahtzee-bot
* a discord bot you can use to play yahtzee (currently only single player, multiplayer comming... maybe???)
* use !help to list the commands of the bot
* this is just code, if someone wants to use the bot, they will have to create a bot in the discord developer portal, supply their own token, and host the bot
* Probably could clean up the code a little too, but it works and I'm proud of myself for actually finishing a project
